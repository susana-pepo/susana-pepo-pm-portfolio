01 — ABOUT
=====================================

Panel title: A user-centered approach to product management.

Paragraph 1: I started in education and special needs, where I learned how people actually learn — not from frameworks, but from watching real users navigate challenges in ways you'd never predict. That foundation shapes everything about how I approach product.

Paragraph 2: Today I bring that understanding to product development at Learnfield GmbH, where I manage product, content, and licensing across two music learning apps — Skoove (piano, 1M+ users) and Trala (violin). I hold three distinct roles simultaneously: Product Owner, Education Content Manager, and License Manager.

Paragraph 3: My work sits at the intersection of business, creative, and technical domains. In any given week, I might negotiate a multi-year licensing deal with a major publisher, ship an iOS feature that removes onboarding friction, and coordinate a Japanese localization across three parallel workstreams. I like that range. It's where I do my best thinking.

03 — WORK (Case Studies)
=====================================

Panel title: How I think, how I ship.


--- Case 1 ---
Title: UMPI Licensing Negotiation
Subtitle: Bridging music and product through a €380K deal
Tags: Negotiation, Financial Modeling, Stakeholder Mgmt

Problem: Complex multi-publisher licensing for a music learning app with 1M+ users. Needed to structure a sustainable deal covering free trials, recoupment, and multi-market reporting obligations.

Process: Market share analysis, financial modeling of advance structures, stakeholder alignment across legal, finance, and executive teams. Designed 4-installment payment schedule and recoupment tracking via BMAT.

Outcome: €380K multi-year deal closed. Automated reporting pipeline scoped (3-sprint plan). Cost ratio monitoring built — Jan 2026: licensing costs improved from 18% to 14.7% of revenue.


--- Case 2 ---
Title: Trala Japanese Localization
Subtitle: From zero to market across three parallel workstreams
Tags: International PM, Localization, Vendor Mgmt

Problem: Launch a violin learning app in the Japanese market from scratch — no existing translations, no dubbing infrastructure, no localization pipeline for the product.

Process: Hired and managed a 4-person localization team (2 translators, 1 dubbing specialist, 1 PM). Designed three parallel workstreams: iOS static strings, educational text, and video dubbing. Built QA framework and cost tracking.

Outcome: Three workstreams running simultaneously, on track for delivery targets. Full iOS Localizable.strings cleanup including scripts for unused key detection. Coordinated across Berlin, Japan, and UK stakeholders.


--- Case 3 ---
Title: Reducing Onboarding Friction
Subtitle: The No Sign-Up feature that improved App Store sentiment
Tags: User Research, Agile Delivery, Cross-functional

Problem: Mandatory sign-up was creating friction for new users and hurting App Store ratings. User feedback consistently pointed to onboarding as the first barrier to engagement.

Process: Analyzed user feedback and App Store reviews. Scoped the feature removal alongside a paywall fix. Coordinated 2 developers, QA, design, and CPO alignment within sprint cycles.

Outcome: Shipped iOS 7.5.1 with mandatory sign-up removed and paywall optimized. Reduced the first barrier for new users, directly targeting the onboarding friction & App Store sentiment epic.


--- Case 4 ---
Title: License Planning Financial Model
Subtitle: Bringing product domain knowledge to financial planning
Tags: Financial Acumen, Process Design, Cross-domain

Problem: Finance team couldn't maintain the licensing financial model alone — it required product and content domain knowledge they didn't have. Cost projections were becoming unreliable.

Process: Took over through a structured handover series with Finance (Nov 2025). Built a QA framework with cost-to-revenue ratio checks, customer number validation, and formula audits across 6+ spreadsheet tabs.

Outcome: Self-sustaining financial model with automated checks. Monthly reporting to leadership. Revenue grew from €236K to €315K (Dec '25 → Jan '26). Licensing cost share improved: 18% → 14.7%.


--- Case 5 ---
Title: Content Strategy at Scale
Subtitle: Seasonal campaigns and data-driven curation with copyright constraints
Tags: Content Strategy, Data-driven, Multi-stakeholder

Problem: Keeping content fresh and engaging across a music learning app with complex copyright constraints. Every content decision has licensing implications that affect cost-to-revenue ratios.

Process: Built usage data analysis pipeline (Mixpanel → CSV). Curated from major publisher catalogues. Designed seasonal planning calendar and multi-language QA process with 5+ proofreaders per release.

Outcome: Regular content drops (Cherry Blossom, Women's Day, Holi collections). Measurable engagement impact. Copyrighted usage tracked monthly against KPI thresholds. Multiple content batches shipped per quarter.
